## Usage
* TradeFusion Lite memorises the position of the open windows and restores the saved positions when the application is started.
* F1 - moves the selected or activated window to the top left corner of the main screen
* F5 - updates (refresh/reload) the content of the selected window (only MOMO or TradingView, the very small main window cannot be updated)

For fans:
These are two small separate windows that navigate to the MOMO or TradingView sites using CEF-Sharp. CEF.Sharp is a Chromium plugin. The software simply listens to the REST calls, extracts the clicked symbol and sends it to the TradingView window.
